# NodeJSintro
My first project using nodejs

TASK 1:
Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side. It was first written by Ryan Dahl in 2009, about 13 years after the introduction of the first server-side JavaScript environment, Netscape’s LiveWire Pro Web. The initial release supported only Linux and Mac OS X. Node.js was initially sponsored by Joyent and later became a part of the Node.js Foundation, which merged with the JS Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation.
*** Uses of Node.js
Node.js is used to develop fast web servers in JavaScript using event-driven programming. It enables developers to create scalable servers without using threading by using a simplified model that uses callbacks to signal the completion of a task. Node.js connects the ease of a scripting language (JavaScript) with the power of Unix network programming. It is often used for server-side scripting, creating web applications, and building RESTful APIs. Node.js is also used for building real-time data-intensive applications, such as chatbots, live updates, and gaming.
*** Importance in Modern Web Development
Node.js is important in modern web development due to its ability to unify web-application development around a single programming language, JavaScript. It allows developers to use the same language for both front-end and back-end development, making it easier to share code and collaborate on projects. Node.js also enables developers to create fast and scalable web servers, making it a popular choice for building real-time data-intensive applications. Additionally, Node.js has a large and active community, with a vast array of packages and frameworks available for building web applications. Overall, Node.js is a powerful tool for building fast, scalable, and maintainable web applications.

*PROJECT OVERVIEW
A NodeJs application that starts a server,recieve and process requests, connects to and retrieve data an external api,and then displaying this data recieved in a webpage.
The application utilizes various aspects of javascript programming such as: modules, asynchronous programming,and an event driven architecture.

*SET UP INSTRUCTIONS
The application set up involves the followinng steps:
- Creating and cloning a github repository into my local syatem.
- Initialing Nodejs in the application repository
- Installing required dependencies.

*HOW TO RUN THE APPLICATION
To run the application:
-Navigate to the application root folder
- In the command terminal run "node index.js"

*DEPENDENCIES
The only dependency used is Axios. it was installed using the npm "npm install axios"

*Summary
From the project and lessons i learnt:
-Installation of NodeJs 
-How to build a web server using nodejs
-Modules and their applications
-Asynchronous Programming
-Event-deiven architecture
